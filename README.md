### Experience

**SiriusXM (formerly Pandora)**
* *Senior Software Engineering Manager* — Feb 2023–Present
* *Staff Software Engineer* — Promoted Aug 2022
* *Senior Software Engineer (L4)* — Promoted Feb 2019
* *Software Engineer (L3)* — Joined in Feb 2018

#### Team Leadership & Culture

Built a high-performing DevEx team practicing ensemble programming, test-driven development (TDD), behavior-driven development (BDD), story mapping, value stream mapping, customer-in-the-room development, and data-driven decision making.

#### Flagship Products

*Luna CLI:* Streamlines deployments to LocalStack and AWS to improve developer cycle time and reload time. Fully instrumented with analytics via Databricks & PlatformX. Event pipeline consists of AWS API Gateway, S3, and Lambda for shipping, storing, and transforming event payloads.

*Platform Portal:* Backstage-powered service catalog and technical documentation hub (adoption and new feature development currently in progress). Catalog ingestion pipeline
leveraged Sourcegraph, AWS Lambda, and S3 to fully automate component discovery with capability to fully recover in the event of data loss. 

#### Additional Achievements

* **Developer Tooling:**
  * *SDE CLI:* AWS workload-opinionated CLI that simplifies login across multiple AWS accounts and environments. Designed and implemented plugin architecture to enable collaboration with autonomous partner teams.
  * *Toil-Reducing Automations:* Developed Lambda-based tooling (Python/TypeScript) to sync users across Opsgenie, Slack, and GitHub organizations.
* **Documentation Experience:**
  * *Cloud Platform Docs:* Git-backed MKdocs site to improved engineering documentation experience (replaced Confluence). Empowered contributions from non-technical stakeholders with robust processes and defect detection.
* **Infrastructure & Operations:**
  * Created internal Docker base images, tested with GOSS, secured with regular scans.
  * Currently leading cloud development environment strategy using Coder and Devcontainers.
  * GitHub Enterprise (Server and Cloud), Sourcegraph, and SonarQube. Maintains onboarding and baseline configuration.
  * Designed and implemented initial Artifactory repository creation, token management, and retention policies and automation still used today.
* **Open Source Leadership:**
  * Active member of SiriusXM's FOSS committee, shaping policy on open-source software usage and contribution.
  * Led alignment on artifact management topology for supply chain resiliency and compliance.
* **Impact Measurement:**
  * Drove a 21-point improvement in the DX aggregate metric for Developer Experience Index (DXI) over 2 years (2023-2024).
  * Improved documentation CSAT by 22 points in 2024.
* **Vendor & Partner Management:** Maintained direct relationships with key vendors including GitHub, SonarSource, Sourcegraph, Postman, JFrog, and Datadog. Negotiated contracts, oversaw renewals, and ensured alignment between tooling capabilities and internal platform goals.

#### Prior Notable Projects

* **BDD Adoption & Tooling:** Led BDD practices across client engineering using Gherkin, Cucumber, and code generation tools. Co-presented at SauceCon 2022.
* **Web CDN:** Designed high-performance, multi-region, on-premises Web CDN with Ceph, Nginx, Anycast, and multi-tier caching & compression. Serves daily peaks of 2K RPS in actual usage with p99 < 1ms and p999 < 10ms. Saved estimated $1M+ in vendor costs.
* **Critical Path Artifact Management Revamp:** Replaced Nexus with Ceph for _large_ artifact delivery consumed by internal, propietary tooling: Dora and Pandora VMs. Used expand-contract and branch-by-abstraction techniques to accomplish gradual and seamless migration. Stabilized CI, deployments, and general Nexus availability for day-to-day use by engineering teams.

### Additional Experience (Condensed)

#### Comcast

Spent 4 years as a software engineer, beginning as a build and release engineer focused on developing reusable pipeline libraries. Later transitioned into broader software engineering roles, including systems administration for Jenkins, SonarQube, Gerrit, and GitHub. Led and contributed to internal projects such as API-driven traffic shaping for blue-green deployments. Actively contributed to open source projects, including Ansible roles, testinfra, goss, and molecule (now adopted by the Ansible community). Built a strong foundation in infrastructure, monitoring, automation, and platform reliability.
Roles ranging from intern to full-time software engineer. Notable for early experience with systems programming, mentoring, and open source contributions. Supported internal and external platforms with a strong emphasis on problem solving, documentation, and developer support.
